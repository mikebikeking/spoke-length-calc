# Spoke Length Calculator

A precision spoke length calculator for bicycle wheel building, using the same formula as industry-standard tools like DT Swiss.

## Features

- **Accurate calculations** using the DT Swiss spoke length formula
- **Support for all cross patterns**: Radial, 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x
- **Asymmetric rim support** with offset calculations
- **Independent left/right measurements** for rear wheels
- **Clean, professional UI** with print support
- **Input validation** to catch common measurement errors

## Built With

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite + SWC (blazing fast builds)
- Tailwind CSS

## How to Use

1. Measure your rim's ERD (Effective Rim Diameter)
2. Measure hub flange diameters and center-to-flange distances
3. Enter spoke count and select cross pattern
4. Get precise spoke lengths for ordering

## Built by a Wheel Builder

Created by a bicycle mechanic with 20 years of experience building wheels. The calculations are verified against professional tools and real-world wheel builds.

## Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why I Built This

After building thousands of wheels, I wanted a fast, accurate calculator that doesn't require navigating clunky manufacturer websites. This tool combines my mechanical knowledge with modern web development.
